subtitle: An amateur radio operator in VK3

My name is Daryl VK3MCB. I'm interested in vehicle-portable operations with weak-signal digital modes on HF, VHF, UHF, and microwave (23cm). I enjoy JS8 for a QSO with a bit more exchange, but the popularity of FT8 does help with getting the contact numbers above the threshold for a WWFF park activation. QTH is QF22go.
