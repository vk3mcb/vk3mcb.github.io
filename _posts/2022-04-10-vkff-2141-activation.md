The Metcalfe Nature Conservation Reserve is a 20-minute drive north from Kyneton in Victoria. Having turned off the road into Metcalfe, the track leads along a ridge that gives good elevation at 530m ASL and nice views to the south-west.

There aren't many places to pull off the track and set up but there are a couple with not too many overhanging trees or branches that might interfere with an antenna. I settled on one near the top of the ridge.

My Spiderbeam 10m aluminium telescopic mast and tripod are pretty heavy but I really like their sturdiness. I usually put up three guys to make sure it doesn't topple over in a sudden gust of wind; it never has but it's best to be sure. I put up my Aerial-51 404-UL asymmetric dipole. Mast and antenna setup takes a while but I'm getting faster. I like the Aerial-51 because it easily tunes to lower than SWR 2:1 or so on 40m, 20m, and 15m.

I had trouble self-spotting; I could see updates on the Parks & Peaks (PnP) spot page but I couldn't add a spot myself due to poor coverage of the mobile data network at that location. My first JS8 contact was with Alan VK2MET on 40m who kindly offered to spot me on PnP and POTA. After that I had a couple more QSOs with JS8 followed by some with FT8 to make a total of 15 QSOs and my first successful activation.

JS8Call is great for an exchange with a bit more information than the minimalist QSO that's possible with FT8. Alan VK2MET let me know that he added a spot for me, and I was able to let contacts know a bit of information about where I was and the setup I was using. It makes for a more enjoyable interaction.

Before my next activation attempt I'll sort out my self-spotting system for when I'm off the mobile data grid. I'll talk about that in the next post.

An activation is only possible with participation of the chasers and spotters; many thanks to them.
