The Metcalfe Nature Conservation Reserve is a 20-minute drive north from Kyneton in Victoria. A track leads along the ridge that gives good elevation at 530m ASL and views to the south-west.

There aren't many places to pull off the track but there are a couple with not too many overhanging trees or branches that might interfere with an antenna.
