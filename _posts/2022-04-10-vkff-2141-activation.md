The Metcalfe Nature Conservation Reserve is a 20-minute drive north from Kyneton in Victoria. Having turned off the road into Metcalfe, the track leads along a ridge that gives good elevation at 530m ASL and nice views to the south-west.

There aren't many places to pull off the track and set up but there are a couple with not too many overhanging trees or branches that might interfere with an antenna.
